        Popcorn Time is a multi-platform, free software BitTorrent client that includes an integrated media player.
        The applications provide a free alternative to subscription-based video streaming services such as Netflix. 
        Popcorn Time uses sequential downloading to stream video listed by several torrent websites, and third party trackers can also be added manually.
